  <p>Chicago-based violinist Henry X. Zheng engages in a vibrant and fulfilling career as a chamber musician, recitalist, orchestral performer, and arts administrator. Performances have taken Mr. Zheng across the United States and to stages around
    the world, including venues in China, Italy, and Mexico. Recent awards include residency at the Avaloch Farm Music Institute, and an Individual Artists Project Grant from the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events. Stage
    highlights include appearances with the three-time Grammy Award nominated Spektral Quartet, the Kontras Quartet, and National Heritage Fellowship award winner Rahim Alhaj. Album and media credits include releases with Access Contemporary Music,
    Lakeshore Rush, Chicago Arts Orchestra, and Chicago Film Project. In his spare time, Henry enjoys playing video games, browsing the aisles at his local comic book store, and adding to his growing collection of weapons-grade hot sauces.</p>
